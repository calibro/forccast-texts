The Forccast program is a laureate of the call for projects on Initiatives of Excellence in Innovative Training (Initiatives d’excellence en formations innovantes ([IDEFI](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/investissements-d-avenir/appels-a-projets/2011/initiatives-dexcellence-en-formations-innovantes-idefi/)) of the French National Agency for Research. It is financed from 2012 through 2019.

Forccast includes fourteen higher education and research institutions. Among its partners are institutions from both higher and lower education, specialized in social and engineering sciences in France and abroad. SciencesPo hosts the Forccast project.

Forccast’s activities focus on the interactions between science, technology and society (STS). The program’s goal is to train different audiences on the exploration of contemporary controversies, which emanate from the massive proliferation of scientific and technical innovations.

In order to do so, Forccast proposes two complementary methods, both of which transform students into agents of their own training: controversy mapping[^lien-controversy] and simulation of negotiation and debate[^lien-simulation]. These experiences aim to teach students on how to research, think critically and express themselves in situations of uncertainty. 

Forccast deploys such teaching methods by developing and utilizing the necessary [pedagogical resources, tutorials, digital technologies, training of trainers](/en/resources), classrooms[^salle-de-classe], etc.
