# forccast-texts

Write your text in using ```markdown``` syntax.

For adding notes to your document follow these rules:

```
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.
```
